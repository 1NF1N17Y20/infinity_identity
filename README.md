# infinity_identity
Project X's identity script.

Contact me here https://discord.gg/wMD6Ed2szp for assistance.

We are no longer needing this version of our identity script because we are moving to JSON.

Installation:
1. You will need mysql-async (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-mysql-async-library-3-3-2/21881)
2. start mysql-async first
3.  then start infinity_identity (https://github.com/1NF1N17Y20/infinity_identity)

Copy Paste into .cfg
ensure mysql-async
ensure infinity_identity
